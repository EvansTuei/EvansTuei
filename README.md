- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EvansTuei
- ðŸ‘€ An Impact-driven data specialist with experience in SQL, Python, experimentation (traditional A/B testing and custom experimental designs), causal inference, 
machine learning, ETL, time series forecasting, and business recommendation-focused data analysis. 
Domain agnostic, but particularly enjoy working on growth teams, accelerating growth through creative strategies, product innovation, 
data-driven insights, and rigorous experimentation. I love that I get to flex my creative thinking, business judgment, product sense, 
coding, modeling and communication skills all in one job! :)
